Start the program using:
```

```

##Installation instructions:

###Linux

You will almost certainly figure it out on your own.

###Windows

Install the following:
* [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6) 
* [wxPython](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wxpython) (python binding for wxWidgets)
* [six](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#six) (required by matplotlib)
* [dateutil](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python* dateutil) (required by matplotlib)
* [pyparsing](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyparsing) (required by matplotlib)
* [NumPy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy) (required by matplotlib)
* [Pytz](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pytz) (required by matplotlib)
* [matplotlib](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib) (graphing utility)
* [pygobject](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/files/?source=navbar) (you only need the GExiv2 wrapper.  It's labeled as libgexiv or something.  Needed to remove EXIF metadata.) 
* [OpenCV](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv) (image manipulation)

###Mac OS X

Switch to a different operating system.  Installing OpenCV properly is a pain due to Mac default configurations.  If you are determined to use the yeast counter on a Mac, refer to the section below.

##Troubleshooting:

If you are receiving cryptic errors or are otherwise having issues, an excellent resource for tackling problems can be found [here](http://www.google.com).  If that doesn't work, I can be reached by the email given above.
